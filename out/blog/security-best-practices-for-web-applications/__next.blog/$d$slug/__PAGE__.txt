      <p>Web application security is an ongoing concern that requires attention at every stage of development. Attackers are constantly finding new vulnerabilities, so staying informed and implementing security best practices is essential for protecting user data and maintaining trust.</p>
      
      <p>Authentication and authorization are fundamental security concerns. Implementing strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and proper session management helps prevent unauthorized access. OAuth and JWT tokens should be implemented correctly with appropriate expiration times and secure storage. Never store passwords in plain text - always use strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.</p>
      
      <p>Input validation is critical for preventing injection attacks. All user input should be validated and sanitized on both the client and server side. SQL injection, XSS, and command injection attacks often exploit insufficient input validation. Use parameterized queries for database operations and escape output to prevent XSS attacks. Content Security Policy headers can also help mitigate XSS risks.</p>
      
      <p>HTTPS should be used for all communications, not just login pages. Encrypting data in transit protects it from interception. Use strong TLS configurations and keep certificates up to date. HTTP Strict Transport Security headers force browsers to use HTTPS, preventing downgrade attacks.</p>
      
      <p>Dependency management is often overlooked but crucial. Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like npm audit or Snyk to identify vulnerable packages. Be cautious about adding new dependencies - each one increases your attack surface. Review dependencies for security issues before including them in your project.</p>
      
      <p>Error handling should never expose sensitive information. Generic error messages for users prevent information leakage, while detailed error logs for developers help with debugging. Be careful about what information appears in stack traces, as these can reveal system architecture and potential attack vectors.</p>
      
      <p>Rate limiting protects against brute force attacks and denial of service attempts. Implement limits on login attempts, API calls, and other sensitive operations. This prevents attackers from trying thousands of password combinations or overwhelming your system with requests.</p>
      
      <p>Security headers provide additional layers of protection. Headers like X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Content-Security-Policy help prevent various attack vectors. These are easy to implement and provide significant security benefits with minimal effort.</p>
      
      <p>Regular security audits and penetration testing help identify vulnerabilities before attackers do. Automated scanning tools can catch many issues, but manual security reviews provide deeper insights. Consider engaging security professionals for critical applications, especially those handling sensitive data.</p>
      
      <p>Finally, keep security in mind throughout the development process, not just at the end. Security reviews should be part of code review processes, and security considerations should influence architectural decisions. Building security in from the start is much more effective than trying to add it later.</p>
