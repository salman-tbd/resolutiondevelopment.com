      <p>Building fast React applications requires understanding how React works under the hood and applying optimization techniques strategically. Performance issues often creep in as applications grow, but with the right approach, you can keep your app responsive even as complexity increases.</p>
      
      <p>One of the most effective optimizations is using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders. When a component receives the same props, React.memo can skip rendering that component entirely. This is particularly valuable for components that render frequently or have expensive rendering logic. However, it's important to use it judiciously - wrapping every component can actually hurt performance due to the comparison overhead.</p>
      
      <p>Code splitting is essential for large applications. Using React.lazy and Suspense allows you to load components only when they're needed. This reduces the initial bundle size and improves time to interactive. Route-based code splitting is a common pattern, but you can also split at the component level for heavy features that aren't immediately visible.</p>
      
      <p>Virtualization becomes crucial when rendering long lists. Libraries like react-window or react-virtualized render only the visible items, dramatically improving performance for lists with hundreds or thousands of items. This technique is especially important for data tables, chat applications, and feed-based interfaces.</p>
      
      <p>State management plays a significant role in performance. Keeping state as local as possible prevents unnecessary re-renders across the component tree. When you need shared state, consider using context carefully - context updates cause all consuming components to re-render, so splitting contexts by concern can help minimize this impact.</p>
      
      <p>Memoization with useMemo and useCallback can prevent expensive recalculations and function recreations. However, these hooks have their own overhead, so they should be used when the computation is genuinely expensive or when you're passing functions to memoized child components. Overusing them can actually make your code slower.</p>
      
      <p>Image optimization is often overlooked but can have a huge impact. Using Next.js Image component or similar solutions provides automatic optimization, lazy loading, and responsive images. For applications with many images, this can reduce load times significantly.</p>
      
      <p>Finally, profiling your application with React DevTools Profiler helps identify actual bottlenecks rather than guessing. Measure before and after optimizations to ensure you're making real improvements. Sometimes the performance issue isn't where you think it is.</p>
