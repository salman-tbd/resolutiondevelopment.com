      <p>Database performance directly impacts application responsiveness and user experience. Slow queries can make even well-designed applications feel sluggish. Understanding how databases work and applying optimization techniques can dramatically improve performance.</p>
      
      <p>Indexing is one of the most effective optimization techniques. Proper indexes can turn queries that take seconds into queries that complete in milliseconds. However, indexes come with trade-offs - they consume storage space and slow down write operations. The key is identifying which columns benefit from indexing based on query patterns. Columns used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses are good candidates.</p>
      
      <p>Query optimization requires understanding how your database executes queries. Use EXPLAIN or similar tools to see the query execution plan. Look for full table scans, which indicate missing indexes, and identify opportunities to rewrite queries for better performance. Sometimes a small change in how you write a query can result in dramatically different execution plans.</p>
      
      <p>Normalization is important for data integrity and reducing redundancy, but denormalization can improve read performance. The key is finding the right balance. For read-heavy applications, some denormalization might be worth the trade-off in storage and update complexity. Analyze your access patterns to determine where denormalization makes sense.</p>
      
      <p>Connection pooling reduces the overhead of establishing database connections. Instead of creating a new connection for each request, connections are reused from a pool. This is especially important for applications with high concurrency. Configure pool sizes based on your database's capacity and application load.</p>
      
      <p>Caching can dramatically reduce database load. Frequently accessed data that doesn't change often is a good candidate for caching. In-memory caches like Redis can serve data much faster than database queries. However, cache invalidation is challenging - you need strategies to keep cached data consistent with the database.</p>
      
      <p>Partitioning large tables can improve query performance by allowing the database to scan only relevant partitions. Range partitioning works well for time-series data, while hash partitioning can distribute load evenly. Partitioning requires careful planning and maintenance, but can significantly improve performance for large datasets.</p>
      
      <p>Query result pagination prevents loading large result sets into memory. Instead of fetching all matching records, fetch them in smaller chunks. This reduces memory usage and improves response times. Cursor-based pagination is often more efficient than offset-based pagination for large datasets.</p>
      
      <p>Database maintenance tasks like updating statistics, rebuilding indexes, and cleaning up old data help maintain performance over time. Automated maintenance jobs can handle these tasks during low-traffic periods. Regular monitoring helps identify when maintenance is needed before performance degrades significantly.</p>
      
      <p>Read replicas can distribute read load across multiple database servers. This is particularly useful for read-heavy applications where writes are less frequent. Replication lag needs to be considered - applications that need strongly consistent reads might need to read from the primary database.</p>
      
      <p>Finally, monitor database performance continuously. Set up alerts for slow queries, connection pool exhaustion, and other performance issues. Understanding your database's performance characteristics helps you make informed optimization decisions and catch problems before they impact users.</p>
